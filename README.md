# Hand Gesture-Based Notes Making

The **Hand Gesture-Based Notes Making** project introduces an innovative application that allows users to create notes using simple hand gestures in front of a webcam. This interactive system leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques, including **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow**, to identify and interpret specific hand gestures that correspond to actions commonly performed in digital note-taking.  

The primary goal of this project is to provide an intuitive, hands-free interface for creating and editing notes, making it especially useful for individuals seeking accessible, interactive, and real-time writing solutions.

## Features

The application is designed to interpret three main gestures associated with note-making: **Writing**, **Lifting**, and **Clearing**. Each of these gestures corresponds to a specific function within the application.

### Gesture 1: Writing Mode  
- Tracks the position of the user's middle finger to simulate writing on the screen in real time.  
- By following the path of the middle finger, the system accurately renders the userâ€™s writing movements.  
- This allows for continuous input, mimicking the experience of writing with a pen.  

### Gesture 2: Lift Pen Mode  
- Signals that the user is temporarily lifting the pen without intending to write.  
- Enables pauses or adjustments without unintended marks appearing on the screen.  

### Gesture 3: Clear Screen Mode  
- Clears all written content from the screen.  
- Allows the user to start fresh or reset the writing space as needed.

## User Interface

The **web-based interface** further enhances the user experience by providing an intuitive control panel. It allows users to:  
- Start or stop the note-making application.  
- Clear the screen or reset their work.  
- Extract text from the written notes using integrated text extraction features.
